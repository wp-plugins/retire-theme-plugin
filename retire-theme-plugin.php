Description: DO NOT USE ON PRODUCTION WEBSITE! Allow network administrators to look at theme usage and make announcements about theme retirement and make recommendation which theme to switch to. This is a very useful for network administrator still running some of the older themes for some WordPress network installation. It is a passive agressive way to tell user to switch theme.
